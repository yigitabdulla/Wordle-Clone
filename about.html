        <p style="color: aliceblue; margin-top:10%; margin-left: 50%; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Wordle is a popular online word-guessing game where players have to guess a five-letter secret word chosen by the 
            game's computer program. The player has six attempts to guess the word correctly by entering different five-letter 
            words. After each guess, the game gives feedback by coloring each letter in the guessed word either green, yellow, or 
            gray. A green-colored letter indicates that the letter is in the correct position and is part of the secret word, a 
            yellow-colored letter indicates that the letter is part of the secret word but is in a different position, and a 
            gray-colored letter indicates that the letter is not part of the secret word. The objective of the game is to guess 
            the secret word in as few attempts as possible. Wordle has gained popularity as a fun and challenging game that helps
             players improve their vocabulary and logical reasoning skills.</p>
